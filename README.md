# SEL-Event
Volunteered to create a website for an upcoming event called Social and Emotional Learning, which is a mental health event hosted by Sayreville War Memorial High School in which students and parents gain the knowledge, attitudes, and skills they need to recognize and manage their emotions, establish positive relationships, and make responsible decisions.
